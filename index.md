## Getting started
{% include content/getting_started.md %}

You can ignore the `schemaVersion` at the moment, the important part is that you can
now run your queries with fluent Dart code:

## TODO-List and current limitations
### Limitations (at the moment)
Please note that a workaround for most on this list exists with custom statements.

- No `group by` or window functions

### Planned for the future
These aren't sorted by priority. If you have more ideas or want some features happening soon,
let me know by creating an issue!
- Simple `COUNT(*)` operations (group operations will be much more complicated)
- Support Dart VM apps
- References
  - DSL API
  - Support in generator
  - Validations
- Bulk inserts
- When inserts / updates fail due to invalid data, explain why that happened
### Interesting stuff that would be nice to have
Implementing this will very likely result in backwards-incompatible changes.

- Find a way to hide implementation details from users while still making them
  accessible for the generated code
- `GROUP BY` grouping functions 
- Support for different database engines
  - Support webapps via `AlaSQL` or a different engine
