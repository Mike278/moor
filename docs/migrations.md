# Migrations
Moor provides a migration API that can be used to gradually apply schema changes after bumping
the `schemaVersion` getter inside the `Database` class. To use it, override the `migration`
getter. Here's an example: Let's say you wanted to add a due date to your todo entries:
```dart
class Todos extends Table {
  IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();
  TextColumn get title => text().withLength(min: 6, max: 10)();
  TextColumn get content => text().named('body')();
  IntColumn get category => integer().nullable()();
  DateTimeColumn get dueDate => dateTime().nullable()(); // we just added this column
}
```
We can now change the `database` class like this:
```dart
  @override
  int get schemaVersion => 2; // bump because the tables have changed

  @override
  MigrationStrategy get migration => MigrationStrategy(
    onCreate: (Migrator m) {
      return m.createAllTables();
    },
    onUpgrade: (Migrator m, int from, int to) async {
      if (from == 1) {
        // we added the dueDate property in the change from version 1
        await m.addColumn(todos, todos.dueDate);
      }
    }
  );

  // rest of class can stay the same
```
You can also add individual tables or drop them. You can't use the high-level query API in
migrations. If you need to use it, please specify the `onFinished` method on the 
`MigrationStrategy`. It will be called after a migration happened and it's safe to call methods
on your database from inside that method.
